### Zora
API designed to use multiple AI algorithms for any kind of situations, for example compare texts, take information from text,  classify images and find new connections in a network. This repository has a social media to show Zora's flexibility and functionality. This API contains pure JavaScript but in time will get more algorithms, some of them will be implemented in Python.

## About
At the beginning we wanted to create a social media with a dynamic recommendation system to help users to find what they like easily without the complexity of manipulate big data. So we created a system recommendation with AI algorithms but we flexibilize it building an API specialy for it to convert these AI algorithms multiporpose.
